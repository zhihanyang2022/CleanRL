Paper summary: We implement and benchmark recurrent versions of DDPG, TD3 and SAC that uses full history.

This repo offers:

- DDPG, TD3 and SAC (clean PyTorch implementation and benchmarked against stable-baselines3*)
- Recurrent versions of DDPG, TD3 and SAC that use full history: RDPG, RTD3 and RSAC
- Very easy to understand and use; see our exhaustive documentation: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iUy5BslSN4zia7VqxqyRnSda4lJO0thV?usp=sharing)

\*The results of benchmarking can be found in issue "Performance check against SB3" in closed Issues.
